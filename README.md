# book


forward to the reader:
on reading

each page that proceeds the number of people that finish the reading in totality will decrease
and decrement by a percentage.  this is based on (find fact here if it is supported by research) 

the world itself is a very noisy place, engineers have sold millions of microphones and speakers throughout the past century and thereby the world has literally become a noisier place.  It's hard to find any signal within the noise.  Most books that are printed (fact check on this) are not finished by the person that purchased such book.  I think to myself prior to even concieving of writing a book that I will never even finish, but worst of all i hold a conception which propably would be characterized by a false belief that even if i do write such book not (enough) humans will read it.

for if a certain threshold of humans consume the books (regardless of its implications on society negative or positive) then such book is "valuable", but if youre anything like me you glaze over the redundant, shallow, unenlightened, and uncrystalized thoughts of others whose works sold millions.  what is attractive to the masses is independent from it's intrinsic value.  there are books for pleasure and then there are books for utility.  every book written is intended to be read however in my opinion books are a catch 22, because a book is just a collection of text, an image is a representation of visual reality, a video is a sequential sequence of framed images, and audio is just the interpretation of sounds in our environment.  something about silence illicts a something in myself when i read something without having to be very congnisant about how much focus i can maintain before i need to break away.  so in by in large i believe that a book if written by a human is one that a reader will only read if the payoff wether that is in the present moment or in the future will be more valuable than the amount of cognitive work load reaquired for absorbing such information.  


is defined by the amount of cogntive load req
