# book


forward to the reader:
on reading

each page that proceeds the number of people that finish the reading in totality will decrease
and decrement by a percentage.  this is based on (find fact here if it is supported by research) 

the world itself is a very noisy place, engineers have sold millions of microphones and speakers throughout the past century and thereby the world has literally become a noisier place.  It's hard to find any signal within the noise.  Most books that are printed (fact check on this) are not finished by the person that purchased such book.  I think to myself prior to even concieving of writing a book that I will never even finish, but worst of all i hold a conception which propably would be characterized by a false belief that even if i do write such book not (enough) humans will read it.

for if a certain threshold of humans consume the books (regardless of its implications on society negative or positive) then such book is "valuable", but if youre anything like me you glaze over the redundant, shallow, unenlightened, and uncrystalized thoughts of others whose works sold millions.  what is attractive to the masses is independent from it's intrinsic value.  there are books for pleasure and then there are books for utility.  every book written is intended to be read however in my opinion books are a catch 22, because a book is just a collection of text, an image is a representation of visual reality, a video is a sequential sequence of framed images, and audio is just the interpretation of sounds in our environment.  something about silence illicts a something in myself when i read something without having to be very congnisant about how much focus i can maintain before i need to break away.  so in by in large i believe that a book if written by a human is one that a reader will only read if the payoff wether that is in the present moment or in the future will be more valuable than the amount of cognitive work load reaquired for absorbing such information.  


i am professionally trained and educated in using programming languages to program hardware, firmware, and software.  however as tools evolve to agents more humans will be turning to large language models for information.  

i am not a ludite, i love computation, however i believe engineering should be minized and only optimized for survival requirements
in complexity theory you learn that the larger the space / time compleity the larger the liability.

if a digital system can be electrical in nature and perform at the same level then it should be electrical
if an electrical system can be mechanical in nature and perform at the same level then it should be mechanical
and if a mechanical system can be "natural" in nature and perform at the same level then it should be natural

natural means requires zero human involvement or interception

however maybe these beliefs are archiaic and pale in comparison to what computation has to offer life on this planet.
well specific types of life.

evolution favored humans and humans favored themselves 

and i think the amount of engineering that is occuring is happening at too fast of a rate, however that is not something i can control and as a software engineer by trade i want to explain to the laymane why your own adaptation to our environment and our economy will be something that needs to be of primary concern for "you".  when i say "you", i am referring to any person born during or after the year of 2000.

there will be more machine producing knowlege than humans (check facts on this and connect it to a statistic)

here is knowledge produced by a human and if you so please value another member of your species, for a new form of machine intelligence can capture more of your attention than potentially anything else.

if it's too hard to read and pay attention, especicially if a paycheck isnt on the line and there are a trillion other videos to watch, pictures to see, and podcasts to listen to you can consume this information via this limk which will redirect you to a audio/videp representation of this book

where the text casscased as is simultaneously read by a reader, who is me.  it is said that listening to an audio book is drinking your vegetables, but reading a book is like eating them...  and you loose all the fiber when you drink your veggiges.  so i am glad you are ready to embarck on a journey that will engage in the only thing you have in this world, your consciousness.

note to the reader:
who cares about a humans quality of existence more than a machine

most authors concieve of an idea or a story that can only be cotified by a book
however i am not an author and i have no one idea, but rather a concoffeny of small ideas that can be transformed into a collection of essays on my observations of reality, the reality of my mind, and the reality of my mind within reality.  observations, commentaries, generalizations, opinions, facts, fallicies subjective in nature, and truths objective in nature, all combined in such a way that directly reflects on how i model the world.  much of this book will contain discrete and segmented topics within fields far separated yet univerally integrated with eachother.  from ideas in mathematics, computer science, philosophy, economics, and much more i attempt to write something without using an LLM (figure 1) suductively whispering in my ear.
